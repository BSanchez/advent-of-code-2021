# Third day

Our submarine does weird nodes, and we need to extract 2 numbers out of it using
bitwise operations.

# Bitwise operations

Well, Elixir has a Bitwise module and I am reaaaaly versed in bitwise operations,
so, we will use bitwise operations.

This exercice is the easiest so far, and I had a working solution inside iex in
less than 10 minutes. I could refactor this crap, but I guess my time will be
better invested in another aspect : structuring and reusing parts of code.
