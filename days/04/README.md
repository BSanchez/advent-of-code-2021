# Fourth day

We will need to play bingo with a giant squid. And we will cheat.

## I DO BE DUMB

This exercice was HELL. Worst, it was hell for nothing. 

For the first part, I lost at least 1 hour figuring 0 is an available number 
in bingo, so replacing already picked numbers by 0 on my boards will do wonders 
when I will need to sum, but it will also make boards finish too early in some 
situations.

For the part two, I derped again, and lost way to much time figuring I need to
wait until the last board win before calculating it's score.

# Using CLI arguments

For helping the debug, I created a way to load an alternative input file, name
(for example inputs/04.example). If you are interested, I recommend you to check
./lib/advent_of_code.ex
