# ADVENT OF CODE 2021

Santa's elven have failed hard (like any other year) and we need to get the
sleigh keys back from the bottom of the ocean. And for this we will need to read
a file, parse and loop over values intil we get them back !

## Why this devblog

Advent of code is one of my favorit part of the year for discovering new
technologies or focusing hard on things I know but don't use as much as I want.

Last year I've done all the exercices in Neovim, it was fun and I really regret
not having kept a devblog. This year, for sake of keeping traces and don't 
regret it later I will keep trace of everything I do !

## Language of choice for this year : Elixir

This year, my choice is... Elixir ! As I write today, I'v never touched Elixir. 
I know it's functionnal, it run on Erlang VM, and that's pretty much it.

So let's start with `Day01` !

## Notes about this devblog/repo

Blog posts are written on the day I complete a challenge, and generally at the
same time, do don't be triggered by present/past/futur mixing of the phrases.

I will make a iron rull about letting the solutions as they are. I have already
done some refactoring and I guess I will do some other, but it will only affect
meta and organisations. Dirty solutions will remain dirty, but by the end of the
challenge I hope my progress will be clear.
